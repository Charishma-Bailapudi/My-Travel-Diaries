        Amsterdam is the nominal capital of the Netherlands but not the seat of government, which is The Hague. The royal family, for example, 
        is only occasionally in residence at the Royal Palace, on the square known as the Dam, in Amsterdam. The city lacks the monumental
        architecture found in other capitals. There are no wide squares suitable for big parades, nor are there triumphal arches or imposing 
        statues. Amsterdam’s intimate character is best reflected in the narrow, bustling streets of the old town, where much of the population
        still goes about its business. While there are reminders of the glorious past—gabled houses, noble brick facades clad with sandstone,
        richly decorated cornices, towers and churches, and the music of carillons and barrel organs—the realities of life in the modern city
        often belie this romantic image.

        Amsterdam took it's time to come into the European tourism scene, always living under the shadow of other major cities such as Milan,
        Paris and London. However, once the true potential of the city was unlocked, it became one of the most popular holiday destinations
        for tourists coming into the continent and European citizens as a whole. The city had mostly gained popularity in the early years for
        its red light district, for its nightlife and a relaxed attitude towards soft drugs. Now, after the renovations of the famous Museumplein,
        which houses the Rijksmuseum, the Van Gogh museum and the Stedelijk Museum of Modern Art, the city has regained its enchanting artistic 
        heritage, and has truly become a world-class destination for museums.

        Ditch everything and rent a bike, have a picnic in the Vondelpark, go shopping in the streets of Jordaan, cruise in Amsterdam's picturesque
        canals, eat popular street foods such as the herring at the herring carts, visit the historical house of Anne Frank, or go beer tasting at
        de Gooyer's Brouwerij 'Tij (and the tons of microbreweries on offer throughout the city). The list of things you can do in this city is truly
        endless. Amsterdam is an absolute must visit on your European itinerary!
